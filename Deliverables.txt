//describe the aditional method you created

My additional method is called status. This method will return what type of shopping status you have. 
If you spent less than $10 you get Silver Status and the method will return "Silver Status". If you spend $10 or
above but less than 20 you have earned gold status and the method will return "Gold Status". If you spend above $20 
you have earned platinum status and the method will return "Platinum Status". 


one limitation

One limitation with my program is that it doesn't account for coupons/sale items. This is important as it is common
that items at a grocery store differ prices month to month. My program would improve if this limitation is accounted
for as it would be more accurate to the real world.
